            <h2>Choosing a Business Reflection</h2>

                During the first two weeks of class we have learned about choosing different products as well as business models that might be good for our business that we have to run this semester. I have been thinking about different aspects of business that will lead to my decision on what model to choose. I have also been trying to think of a product that would work, and I want to do something that is both viable for me to be able to produce, and something that I think will sell. I haven't used Google Ads Keyword search to help me yet, but I've been thinking of doing a dropshipping site where you upload a design for a T-shirt, and they will print and ship the item for you. The site that I'm currently looking at is called <a href="https://printful.com">Printful</a>.<img src="images/printful.png"> I have already been thinking about designs that I'm passionate about, and it would give me an excuse to test my design skills from my graphics design classes.
